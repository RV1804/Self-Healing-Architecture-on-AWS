Self-Healing Infrastructure on AWS with Terraform
This project showcases how to deploy a resilient, self-healing infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. The goal is to automate cloud resource provisioning and ensure high availability through automatic recovery of failed components.
🔍 Project Summary
The system is designed to run across multiple availability zones, using Terraform scripts to create and manage resources like VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, load balancers, and auto scaling groups. It ensures that if an instance fails, a new one is automatically launched to maintain uptime.
🧰 Tools & Services Used
•	• Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for automating deployments
•	• AWS EC2 – Virtual server instances
•	• VPC & Subnets – Custom network setup
•	• Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) – For automatic recovery and scaling
•	• Load Balancer (ALB) – Distributes incoming traffic across instances
📁 Project Files
main.tf – Main configuration for AWS resources
variables.tf – Input variables used across the project
README.md – Project documentation
.gitignore – Excluded files and folders for Git
⚙️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
